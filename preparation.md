## Preparation

1. Research Questions\
    What makes a movie "good"?  
    What trends can we extract from movies given their popularity, ratings, and genres?  

2. Intended Audience\
    Movie buffs

3. Data Sets\
    Our data was downloaded from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. The downloaded data was in the form of relational tables.  
    The ratings.csv contains rating entries that include a movie id, user id, the rating, and a timestamp.  
    movies.csv links movie ids to titles and genres.  
    tags.csv contains descriptive tags that users applied to movies, and genome-scores.csv determines how relevant a tag is to a given movie.

4. Tools and Techniques\
    The tools and techniques used were making different plots and finding diffrent points of data using plotly in jupyter notebooks.

5. Types of Visualizations (Edit)\
    The types of visualizations we used were stacked bar charts and dotplots as these were the best to show either scattered data for the dot plot and with the stacked bar charts those effectively showed data when two y-axis were used.

6. Choice of Analysis and Visualization Strategy\
    We chose these methods from looking at our data and what relationships we thought it would be interesting to plot and picked these visualizations from how our data was structured. 

7. Hope of Impact\
    Hopefully, movie watchers and programmers can use this data to find more relevant recommendations, and better evaluate the quality of new releases.
