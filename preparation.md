## Preparation

1. Research Questions\
    What makes a movie "good"?  
    What trends can we extract from movies given their popularity, ratings, and genres?  

2. Intended Audience\
    Movie buffs

3. Data Sets\
    Our data was downloaded from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. The downloaded data was in the form of relational tables.  
    The ratings.csv contains rating entries that include a movie id, user id, the rating, and a timestamp.  
    movies.csv links movie ids to titles and genres.  
    tags.csv contains descriptive tags that users applied to movies, and genome-scores.csv determines how relevant a tag is to a given movie.
